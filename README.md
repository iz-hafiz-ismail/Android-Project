# Native_Android-Full-Project
There are two main languages for native android development. It was Java and Kotlin. From my observation, people have left java for Kotlin due to google saying that Kotlin will be the main language for android development but people can still use Java for development. Please keep in mind that my project structure is quite messy because this was a collection of my past project. I just optimized the code without changing the base code. If there are any issues, with my code, feel free to open a pull request or ask the question.

### Kotlin
- **[AllChef - Recipe application](https://github.com/iz-hafiz/RecipeApps-Hafiz-Android-Kotlin)** <br>
Basic Recipe application that user can display, edit, add and delete the recipe. A remote database was used for auth and a local database was for keeping recipe data. The recipe data in JSON format will be loaded up when the user is using the app for the first time. User can also reset the database. I created this project due to my job assessment for the mobile developer role where I was given a task to complete a recipe apps within 3 days. 


### Java
- **[BlackJack - Blackjack application]()** <br>
BlackJack is an app where you can play blackjack with comp. The animation was quite bad as I just code the animation myself using XML. So don't expect too much as it is the first app that my friend and I collaborated on together. My friend handles the auth and database-related code and I only do the BlackJack logic game. Both of us does the front-end together.
