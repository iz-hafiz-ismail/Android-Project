# Native_Android-Full-Project
There are two main language for native android development. It was Java and Kotlin. Nowdays, from my observation. People have left java for Kotlin due to google said that Kotlin will be main language for android development but people can still use Java for development. Please keep in mind that my project structure quite messy, because this was collection of my pass project. I just optimized the code without changing the base code. If there any issue, with my code, feel free to open a pull request or asking the question.

### Kotlin
- **[AllChef - Recipe application](https://github.com/iz-hafiz/RecipeApps-Hafiz-Android-Kotlin)** <br>
Basic Recipe application that user can display, edit, add and delete recipe. Remote data base was used for auth and local database was for keeping recipe data. The recipe data is Json format and load up when user fiirst time using the apps. User can also reset the database. The reason this project was created due to my job assesment for mobile role where i was task to complete a recipe apps within 3 days.
