# Native_Android-Full-Project
There are two main language for native android development. It was Java and Kotlin. Nowdays, from my observation. People have left java for Kotlin due to google said that Kotlin will be main language for android development but people can still use Java for development. Please keep in mind that my project structure quite messy, because this was collection of my pass project. I just optimized the code without changing it base. If there any issue, with my code, feel free to open a pull request or asking the question.
